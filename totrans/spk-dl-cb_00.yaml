- en: With deep learning gaining rapid mainstream adoption in modern-day industries,
    organizations are looking for ways to unite popular big data tools with highly
    efficient deep learning libraries. This will help deep learning models train with
    higher efficiency and speed.

- en: With the help of *Apache Spark Deep Learning Cookbook*, you'll work through
    specific recipes to generate outcomes for deep learning algorithms without getting
    bogged down in theory. From setting up Apache Spark for deep learning to implementing
    types of neural nets, this book tackles both common and not-so-common problems
    in order to perform deep learning on a distributed environment. In addition to
    this, you'll get access to deep learning code within Spark that can be reused
    to answer similar problems or tweaked to answer slightly different problems. You‘ll
    also learn how to stream and cluster your data with Spark. Once you have got to
    grips with the basics, you'll explore how to implement and deploy deep learning
    models such as CNN, RNN, and LSTMs in Spark using popular libraries such as TensorFlow
    and Keras. At the end of the day, this is a cookbook designed to teach how to
    practically apply models on Spark, so we will not dive into the theory and math

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning and big
    data concepts and who is looking to expand their understanding through a top-down
    rather than a bottom-up approach. This book gives access to deep learning as well
    as machine learning algorithms in a plug-and-play fashion. Anyone without previous
    programming experience, especially with Python, can easily implement the algorithms
    in this book by following the recipes step by step as instructed. Most of the
    code in this book is self-explanatory. Each code block performs one particular
    function or executes on the action in mining, manipulating, transforming, and
    fitting data to deep learning models.
