    Decision Process** (**MDP**). In the case of MDPs, we introduce a reward to our
    model, and any sequence of states taken by the process results in a specific reward.
    We will also introduce the concept of discounts, which will allow us to control
    how short-sighted or far-sighted we want our agent to be. The goal of the agent
    would be to maximize the total reward that it can get.

- en: Reinforcement learning is a different paradigm in machine learning where an
    agent tries to learn to behave optimally in a defined environment by making decisions/actions
    and observing the outcome of that decision. So, in the case of reinforcement learning,
    the agent is not really from some given dataset, but rather, by interacting with
    the environment, the agent tries to learn by observing the effects of its actions.
    The environment is defined in such a way that the agent gets rewards if its action
    gets it closer to the goal.

- en: Humans are known to learn in this way. For example, consider a child in front
    of a fireplace where the child is the agent and the space around the child is
    the environment. Now, if the child moves its hand towards the fire, it feels the
    warmth, which feels good and, in a way, the child (or the agent) is rewarded for
    the action of moving its hand close to the fire. But if the child moves its hand
    too close to the fire, its hand will burn, hence receiving a negative reward.
    Using these rewards, the child is able to figure out the optimal distance to keep
    its hand from the fire. Reinforcement learning tries to imitate exactly this kind
    of system in order to train the agent to learn to optimize its goal in the given
    environment.

    which represents the world in which the agent should be able to take actions.
    For each of these actions, the environment should return observations which contain
    information about the reward, telling it how good or bad the action was. The observation
    should also have information regarding the next state of the agent in the environment.
    And, based on these observations, the agent tries to figure out the optimal way
    to reach its goal. *Figure 1* shows the interaction between an agent and an environment:'

- en: The thing that makes reinforcement learning fundamentally different from other
    algorithms is that there is no supervisor. Instead, there is only a reward signal
    giving feedback to the agent about the action it took. Another important thing
    to mention here is that an environment can be constructed in such a way that the
    reward is delayed, which can make the agent wander around before reaching its
    goal. It is also possible that the agent might have to go through a lot of negative
    feedback before reaching its goal.

- en: In the case of supervised learning, we are given the dataset, which basically
    tells our learning algorithm the right answers in different situations. Our learning
    algorithm then looks over all these different situations, and the solutions in
    those cases, and tries to generalize based upon it. Hence, we also expect that
    the dataset given to use is **independent and identically distributed** (**IID**).
    But in the case of reinforcement learning the data is not IID, the data generated
    depends on the path the agent took, and, hence, it depends on the actions taken
    by the agent. Hence, reinforcement learning is an active learning process in which
    the actions taken by the agent influence the environment which in turn influences
    the data generated by the environment.

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we started with a short introduction to Reinforcement Learning.
    We talked about agents, rewards and our learning goals in reinforcement learning.
    In the next section, we introduced MRP which is one of the main concepts underlying
    MDP. Having an understanding of MRP we next introduce the concepts of MDP along
    with a code example.

  zh: 在本章中，我们首先简要介绍了强化学习。我们讨论了智能体、奖励和强化学习中的学习目标。在下一节中，我们介绍了MRP，它是MDP的一个主要概念。在理解了MRP之后，我们接下来介绍了MDP的概念，并附上了一个代码示例。
