<p>Have you ever tried to get something novel out of a computer? I can ask you to make up a story or look at a picture and tell me what's in it. How would you make a computer program behave like this in contrast to the digital storage and transfer unit we've used them for these past 30+ yrs?</p>
<p>If you had perfect knowledge and all the time in the world, you could write all the rules by which a computer program would need to operate. Of course, if you had all the knowledge to define the operational rules, you wouldn't need the computer to do anything! So what do you do if you need a computer to function in complex ways (making predictions, classifications, optimizing processes, generating content, responding to interactions, performing robotic controls), but don't have all the heuristic rules defined?</p>
<p>You build an algorithmically-based application that can learn the rules, find the pattern, or determine the signal, from data that comes from the domain space in question. You set up the training such that it iterates incredibly fast and with a great number of cycles (we call them epochs) to provide the "experience" to incrementally train the model in a process that would not be possible in a human lifetime.</p>
<p>When we build these algorithmic architectures in layers, we create deep learning models that can learn features (for example, dogs have tails and cars have wheels) and these learned features are powerful! What we really find in <em>Python Deep Learning Projects</em> is that we can ask profound questions not possible before. It's these questions that drive our deep learning technologies to solve problems that range from healthcare diagnostics in radiology to cancer screening. Deep learning applications drive chatbot experiences, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, recommendation engines, and marketing tech. The hard sciences of physics, biology, and chemistry are incorporating deep learning skills training just as they have in the past with regard to statistics and microscopes. </p>

<p>This book is perfect for you if you've undertaken at least one course in machine learning and have a modest functional proficiency in Python (meaning you can create programs in Python when supported by examples). Many of our readers will be undergraduates at university studying computer science, statistics, mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, marketing, and business. Deep learning technologies are being applied to all the professions that these degrees prepare you for, and this book is a great way to learn skills that will be applicable to your success. Postgraduates will appreciate the instruction level, too, as the projects selected are directly applicable to the modern job market, from tech start-ups to enterprise applications.</p>
<p><em>Python Deep Learning Projects</em> is focused at the core of the data science pipeline – model building, training, evaluation, and validation. Additional pre- and post-data science engineering processes are required in the data pipeline for production applications that we cannot address here due to space considerations, but that we are looking to address in a future publication.  </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p style="color: black">We approach deep learning projects from a very practical point of view. In thinking about how to share what we know, our experiences, the strategies that we've learned, and the tactics we employ, it was natural for us to format this book as if you (the reader) were a member of our Applied AI Engineering team here at The Intelligence Factory. </p>
<p>To get the most out of these projects, you should have at least an average working knowledge of Python and some familiarity with deep learning concepts. This <em>Python Deep Learning Projects</em> book is primarily a technical instruction book with content related to the intuition side of deep learning as required in order to learn the code that will produce functioning models. It is outside the scope of this book to dive deep into the calculus that is the foundation for these technologies.</p>
<p style="color: black">Each chapter is like participating in the AI team's weekly standup. As you engage with the material, you will hopefully do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>See the big picture
<ul>
<li>What's the real-world use case and the goal of the project?</li>
<li>What's the impact of success?</li>
<li>What's our strategy to achieve the goal?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get focused and into the code!
<ul>
<li>Identify specific tactics to achieve the project goal</li>
<li>Why is this the right approach?</li>
<li>Loop through executing the tactics 
<ul>
<li>What are the inputs or establishing context?</li>
<li>Code examples</li>
<li>Outputs and success criteria </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions and answers
<ul>
<li>What questions did we have?</li>
<li>What questions might you have?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expand back out to the big picture
<ul>
<li>Let's confirm that we have achieved our goal</li>
<li>What intuition can we gain from the experience?</li>
<li>How to generalize this successful experience in relation to new use cases?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: black">Explaining Python deep learning is as easy as 1-2-3! But talking about deep learning isn't the same thing as doing, and that's what this book is about. What follows are a few thought provoking and exciting experiences. We will be using the most sophisticated Python libraries and advanced technologies available to empower you (our newest Applied AI Engineering team member) to contribute in your career using the projects we've created in this book. We're happy to have you in our weekly AI team standup. </p>
<p style="color: black">Now let's learn a bunch, have some fun, and do great work in these Python deep learning projects!</p>
