    we will provide a brief introduction to **plugins** in **Auto-GPT**.

- en: As more and more people came up with new ideas on what Auto-GPT could do, we
    realized that it would be impossible to implement all of them into the core project
    of Auto-GPT, so we decided to create a plugin system that allows users to extend
    the functionality of Auto-GPT by adding their own plugins.

- en: Plugins in Auto-GPT serve as modular extensions that enable additional functionality
    and customization of your own Auto-GPT instance. They provide a way to integrate
    external tools, services, and models seamlessly into the Auto-GPT framework. By
    leveraging plugins, you can tailor Auto-GPT to suit specific tasks, domains, or
    applications, such as having your own customer support chat, having your own researching
    AI that gives you suggestions or helps you schedule your calendar, and so much
    more!

    that has text output or non-visual interface (with a little bit of coding, you
    may even make a VS Code plugin that allows Auto-GPT to navigate through projects
    and lines of code).
  prefs: []

- en: Auto-GPT has an official plugin repository that contains a wide range of plugins.
    These plugins were developed as standalone plugins at first, but anyone who wants
    to add their plugin to the official list can do so by submitting a pull request.
    The official plugins are maintained by the Auto-GPT team and are thoroughly tested
    to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Auto-GPT. Although the original
    creator is responsible for maintaining the plugin, the Auto-GPT team will provide
    support and assistance as needed but also remove plugins that are no longer maintained
    and do not work anymore.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To help everyone get started with creating a plugin, the Auto-GPT team has created
    a plugin template that can be used as a starting point for creating your own plugin.
    The template contains all the necessary files and folders required for a plugin,
    including a `README` file with instructions on how to use it. The template is
    available on GitHub and can be downloaded from the repository at [https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template).

    split into chunks of 2,000 characters each, and each chunk is sent as a separate
    message to Telegram. This is essential for ensuring the integrity of the message
    being sent, given the maximum message length constraint in Telegram.
