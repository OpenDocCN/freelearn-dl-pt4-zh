    using Keras, a modular neural network library that runs on top of either Google's
    TensorFlow or Lisa Lab's Theano backends.

- en: The reader is introduced step by step to supervised learning algorithms such
    as simple linear regression, classical multilayer perceptron, and more sophisticated
    deep convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks. In addition,
    the book covers unsupervised learning algorithms such as autoencoders and generative
    networks. Recurrent networks and **long short-term memory** (**LSTM**) networks
    are also explained in detail. The book goes on to cover the Keras functional API
    and how to customize Keras in case the reader's use case is not covered by Keras's
    extensive functionality. It also looks at larger, more complex systems composed
    of the building blocks covered previously. The book concludes with an introduction
    to deep reinforcement learning and how it can be used to build game playing AIs.

    into predefined categories, syntactic analysis of texts, sentiment analysis, synthetic
    generation of texts, and parts of speech annotation. Image processing is also
    explored, with recognition of handwritten digit images, classification of images
    into different categories, and advanced object recognition with related image
    annotations. An example of identification of salient points for face detection
    will be also provided. Sound analysis comprises recognition of discrete speeches
    from multiple speakers. Reinforcement learning is used to build a deep Q-learning
    network capable of playing games autonomously.

    that progressively improve the learning performance by changing the input parameters,
    the shape of the network, loss functions, and algorithms used for optimizations.
    Several comparisons between training on CPUs and GPUs are also provided.

- en: '**Artificial intelligence** (**AI**) is a very large research field, where
    machines show *cognitive* capabilities such as learning behaviours, proactive
    interaction with the environment, inference and deduction, computer vision, speech
    recognition, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, and many others
    (for more information, refer to this article: *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
    Approach*, by S. Russell and P. Norvig, Prentice Hall, 2003). More colloquially,
    AI denotes any activity where machines mimic *intelligent* behaviors typically
    shown by humans. Artificial intelligence takes inspiration from elements of computer
    science, mathematics, and statistics.'

- en: '**Machine learning** (**ML**) is a subbranch of AI that focuses on teaching
    computers how to learn without the need to be programmed for specific tasks (for
    more information refer to *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*, by C. M.
    Bishop, Springer, 2006). In fact, the key idea behind ML is that it is possible
    to create algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data. There are three
    different broad categories of ML. In supervised learning, the machine is presented
    with input data and desired output, and the goal is to learn from those training
    examples in such a way that meaningful predictions can be made for fresh unseen
    data. In unsupervised learning, the machine is presented with input data only
    and the machine has to find some meaningful structure by itself with no external
    supervision. In reinforcement learning, the machine acts as an agent interacting
    with the environment and learning what are the behaviours that generate rewards.'

    **artificial neural networks** (**ANN**) slightly inspired by the structure of
    neurons located in the human brain (for more information, refer to the article *Learning
    Deep Architectures for AI*, by Y. Bengio, Found. Trends, vol. 2, 2009). Informally,
    the word *deep* refers to the presence of many layers in the artificial neural
    network, but this meaning has changed over time. While 4 years ago, 10 layers
    were already sufficient to consider a network as *deep*, today it is more common
    to consider a network as *deep* when it has hundreds of layers.'

- en: DL is a real tsunami (for more information, refer to *Computational Linguistics
    and Deep Learning* by C. D. Manning, "Computational Linguistics", vol. 41, 2015)
    for machine learning in that a relatively small number of clever methodologies
    have been very successfully applied to so many different domains (image, text,
    video, speech, and vision), significantly improving previous state-of-the-art
    results achieved over dozens of years. The success of DL is also due to the availability
    of more training data (such as ImageNet for images) and the relatively low-cost
    availability of GPUs for very efficient numerical computation. Google, Microsoft,
    Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and many others use those deep learning techniques every
    day for analyzing massive amounts of data. However, this kind of expertise is
    not limited any more to the domain of pure academic research and to large industrial
    companies. It has become an integral part of modern software production and therefore
    something that the reader should definitively master. The book does not require
    any particular mathematical background. However, it assumes that the reader is
    already a Python programmer.
