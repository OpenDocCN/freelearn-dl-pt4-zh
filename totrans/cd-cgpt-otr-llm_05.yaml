    humans can be politically biased, both consciously and unconsciously. Code and
    text found online have direct opinions in them. If the prompt or the chatbot’s
    training text has a bias in it, then the chatbot might well decide that biased
    code is needed when you ask it for code. If you train any software with biased
    code or other data, it should be biased. Garbage in, garbage out, as we say so
    often in the software world. I said “should” because these systems are supposed
    to copy what you put into them unless you have very good corrective or modifying
    measures to change that.
