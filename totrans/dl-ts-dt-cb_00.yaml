- en: The writing of this book was motivated by the increasing demand for practical
    approaches to time series analysis and forecasting. Organizations across various
    sectors rely on time series analysis to gain insights into their operations. By
    leveraging time series, these organizations can make informed decisions and optimize
    their performance. Accurate forecasts are valuable assets across many application
    domains, such as retail or economics. These predictions help reduce uncertainty
    and enable better planning of operations. Overall, time series analysis is a valuable
    skill for data scientists to understand and extract meaningful insights from collections
    of observations that evolve over time.

    advances. It is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence where
    models are based on artificial neural networks. Deep learning is foundational
    to many technologies we use and hear about today, including ChatGPT, self-driving
    cars, and advanced image recognition tools. At the same time, deep learning methods
    require significant technical expertise to produce meaningful results.

    applying deep learning to learn from time series data. We present clear and easy-to-follow
    code recipes for applying deep learning to time series data. While the content
    is tailored for beginners, more seasoned machine learning professionals can also
    find value in the nuances of more advanced techniques. The book presents a learn-by-doing
    approach to ensure that you not only understand the main concepts but also know
    how to apply them effectively.
