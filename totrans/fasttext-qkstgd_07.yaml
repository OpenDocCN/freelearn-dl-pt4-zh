- en: In this section, you will learn how to use fastText models in conjunction with
    other popular NLP libraries, such as Gensim and spaCy. You will also learn how
    to make fastText part of your pipeline, which will probably include these other
    tools as well.

    in Python*, is about creating models in Python, either using the official Python
    bindings for fastText, or you can choose to use the Gensim library, which is a
    popular Python library for NLP.

    Learning and Deep Learning Models*, you will understand how to integrate fastText
    into your NLP pipeline if you have pipelines already built using either the statistical
    machine learning or deep learning paradigms. In the case of statistical machine
    learning, this chapter takes the example of the scikit-learn library, and in the
    case of deep learning, Keras, Tensorflow, and PyTorch are taken into account.

    fastText models in live production-grade customer applications.
