- en: Deep learning is probably the hottest technology in data science right now,
    and R is one of the most popular data science languages. However, R is not considered
    as an option for deep learning by many people, which is a shame, as R is a wonderful
    language for data science. This book shows that R is a viable option for deep
    learning, because it supports libraries such as MXNet and Keras.

- en: When I decided to write this book, I had numerous goals. First, I wanted to
    show how to apply deep learning to various tasks, and not just to computer vision
    and natural language processing. This book covers those topics, but it also shows
    how to use deep learning for prediction, regression, anomaly detection, and recommendation
    systems. The second goal was to look at topics in deep learning that are not covered
    well elsewhere; for example, interpretability with LIME, deploying models, and
    using the cloud for deep learning. The last goal was to give an overall view of
    deep learning and not just provide machine learning code. I think I achieved this
    by discussing topics such as how to create datasets from raw data, how to benchmark
    models against each other, how to manage data when model building, and how to
    deploy your models. My hope is that by the end of this book, you will also be
    convinced that R is a valid choice for use in deep learning.

- en: If you have some experience with R and are looking for a book that shows some
    practical examples of how to use R for deep learning, this is the book for you!
    This book assumes that you are familiar with some of the concepts in machine learning,
    such as splitting data into train and test sets. Anyone who has built machine
    learning algorithms in R should have no problem with this book.

    Models*, looks at activations and introduces the MXNet library. We then build
    a deep learning prediction model for a real-life example. We will take a raw dataset
    of transactional data and develop a data pipeline to create a model that predicts
    which customers will return in the next 14 days.'
