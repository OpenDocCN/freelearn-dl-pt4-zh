    the cross-entropy method to the value iteration method are quite encouraging,
    so it’s tempting to apply the value iteration method to more challenging problems.
    However, it is important to look at the assumptions and limitations that our value
    iteration method has. But let’s start with a quick recap of the method. On every
    step, the value iteration method does a loop on all states, and for every state,
    it performs an update of its value with a Bellman approximation. The variation
    of the same method for Q-values (values for actions) is almost the same, but we
    approximate and store values for every state and action. So what’s wrong with
    this process?

    to iterate over them. In value iteration, we assume that we know all states in
    our environment in advance, can iterate over them, and can store their value approximations.

    about other tasks?

    is, or, in other words, how many states we can easily iterate over in every loop.
    Even a moderate-sized computer can keep several billion float values in memory
    (8.5 billion in 32 GB of RAM), so the memory required for value tables doesn’t
    look like a huge constraint. Iteration over billions of states and actions will
    be more central processing unit (CPU)-demanding but is not an insurmountable problem.

    we can iterate over billions of values in a reasonable amount of time. The real
    problem is the number of samples required to get good approximations for state
    transition dynamics. Imagine that you have some environment with, say, a billion
    states (which corresponds approximately to a FrozenLake of size 31600 × 31600).
    To calculate even a rough approximation for every state of this environment, we
    would need hundreds of billions of transitions evenly distributed over our states,
    which is not practical.

    31600 × 31600 大小的 FrozenLake）。要计算这个环境中每个状态的粗略近似，我们需要数百亿个状态之间均匀分布的转换，这在实践中是不可行的。

    states, let’s consider the Atari 2600 game console again. This was very popular
    in the 1980s, and many arcade-style games were available for it. The Atari console
    is archaic by today’s gaming standards, but its games provide an excellent set
    of RL problems that humans can master fairly quickly, yet are still challenging
    for computers. Not surprisingly, this platform (using an emulator, of course)
    is a very popular benchmark within RL research, as I mentioned.

    of the screen has 210 ⋅ 160 = 33600 pixels and the total number of different screens
    possible is 128^(33600), which is slightly more than 10^(70802). If we decide
    to just enumerate all possible states of the Atari once, it will take billions
    of billions of years even for the fastest supercomputer. Also, 99(.9)% of this
    job will be a waste of time, as most of the combinations will never be shown during
    even long gameplay, so we will never have samples of those states. However, the
    value iteration method wants to iterate over them just in case.

- en: The second main problem with the value iteration approach is that it limits
    us to discrete action spaces. Indeed, both Q(s,a) and V (s) approximations assume
    that our actions are a mutually exclusive discrete set, which is not true for
    continuous control problems where actions can represent continuous variables,
    such as the angle of a steering wheel, the force on an actuator, or the temperature
    of a heater. This issue is much more challenging than the first, and we will talk
    about it in the last part of the book, in chapters dedicated to continuous action
    space problems. For now, let’s assume that we have a discrete count of actions
    and that this count is not very large (i.e., orders of 10s). How should we handle
    the state space size issue?

    infinite. For example, in CartPole, the environment gives us a state that is four

    as bits), but this number is extremely large. With just bit values, it is around
    2^(4⋅32) ≈ 3.4 ⋅ 10^(38). In reality, it is less, as state values of the environment
    are bounded, so not all bit combinations of 4 float32 values are possible, but
    the resulting state space is still too large. We could create some bins to discretize
    those values, but this often creates more problems than it solves; we would need
    to decide what ranges of parameters are important to distinguish as different
    states and what ranges could be clustered together. As we’re trying to implement

    ever trying to behave differently. This is the exploration versus exploitation
    dilemma mentioned briefly in Chapter [1](ch005.xhtml#x1-190001), which we will
    discuss in detail now. On the one hand, our agent needs to explore the environment
    to build a complete picture of transitions and action outcomes. On the other hand,

    usual practice is to start with 𝜖 = 1.0 (100% random actions) and slowly decrease
    it to some small value, such as 5% or 2% random actions. Using an epsilon-greedy
    method helps us to both explore the environment in the beginning and stick to
    good policy at the end of the training. There are other solutions to the exploration

    This technique is called a replay buffer. The simplest implementation is a buffer
    of a fixed size, with new data added to the end of the buffer so that it pushes
    the oldest experience out of it.

- en: Another practical issue with the default training procedure is also related
    to the lack of iid data, but in a slightly different manner. The Bellman equation
    provides us with the value of Q(s,a) via Q(s′,a′) (this process is called bootstrapping,
    when we use the formula recursively). However, both the states s and s′ have only
    one step between them. This makes them very similar, and it’s very hard for NNs
    to distinguish between them. When we perform an update of our NNs’ parameters
    to make Q(s,a) closer to the desired result, we can indirectly alter the value
    produced for Q(s′,a′) and other states nearby. This can make our training very
    unstable, like chasing our own tail; when we update Q for state s, then on subsequent
    states, we will discover that Q(s′,a′) becomes worse but attempts to update it
    can spoil our Q(s,a) approximation even more, and so on.

    we keep a copy of our network and use it for the Q(s′,a′) value in the Bellman

    for example, once in N steps (where N is usually quite a large hyperparameter,
    such as 1k or 10k training iterations).

    one single image from the Atari game is not enough to capture all the important
    information (using only one image, we have no idea about the speed and direction
    of objects, like the ball and our opponent’s paddle). This obviously violates
    the Markov property and moves our single-frame Pong environment into the area
    of partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). A POMDP is basically an MDP without the
    Markov property, and it is very important in practice. For example, for most card
    games in which you don’t see your opponents’ cards, game observations are POMDPs
    because the current observation (i.e., your cards and the cards on the table)
    could correspond to different cards in your opponents’ hands.
  id: totrans-90

- en: We won’t discuss POMDPs in detail in this book, but we will use a small technique
    to push our environment back into the MDP domain. The solution is maintaining
    several observations from the past and using them as a state. In the case of Atari
    games, we usually stack k subsequent frames together and use them as the observation
    at every state. This allows our agent to deduct the dynamics of the current state,
    for instance, to get the speed of the ball and its direction. The usual “classical”
    number of k for Atari is four. Of course, it’s just a hack, as there can be longer
    dependencies in the environment, but for most of the games, it works well.

    tensor to the network is ByteTensor. But the Conv2D layer expects the float tensor
    as an input, so by dividing the input tensor by 255.0, we scale to the 0…1 range
    and do type conversion. This is fast, as the input byte tensor is already inside
    the GPU memory. After that, we apply both parts of our network to the resulting
    scaled tensor.

    to reach a mean reward of 17 (which means winning more than 80% of games). A similar
    number of frames will be required to get from 17 to 19, as our learning progress
    will saturate, and it will be hard for the model to “polish the policy” and further
    improve the score. So, on average, a million game frames are needed to train it
    fully. On the GTX 1080Ti, I have a speed of about 250 frames per second, which
    is about an hour of training. On a CPU (i5-7600k), the speed is much slower, about
    40 frames per second, which will take about seven hours. Remember that this is

- en: Due to randomness in the training process, your actual dynamics might differ
    from what is displayed here. In some rare cases (1 run from 10 according to my
    experiments), the training does not converge at all, which looks like a constant
    stream of rewards −21 for a long time. This is not an uncommon situation in deep
    learning (due to the randomness of the training) and might occur even more often
    in RL (due to the added randomness of environment communication). If your training
    doesn’t show any positive dynamics for the first 100k–200k iterations, you should
    restart it.

    only to train the model; we also want our model to play the game with a good outcome.
    During the training, every time we update the maximum of the mean reward for the
    last 100 games, we save the model into the file PongNoFrameskip-v4-best_<score>.dat.
    In the Chapter06/03_dqn_play.py file, we have a program that can load this model
    file and play one episode, displaying the model’s dynamics.

    and then we load weights from the file passed in the arguments. The argument map_location,
    passed to the torch.load() function, is needed to map the loaded tensor location
    from the GPU to the CPU. By default, torch tries to load tensors on the same device
    where they were saved, but if you copy the model from the machine you used for
    training (with a GPU) to a laptop without a GPU, the locations need to be remapped.
    Our example doesn’t use the GPU at all, as inference is fast enough without acceleration.

    zero play quite well. In fact, I had the impression that those models play better
    than models with mean scores of 10–19\. This might be the case due to overfitting
    to the particular game situations. Could you try to fix this? Maybe it would be
    possible to use a generative adversarial network-style approach to make one model
    play with another?

    with the limitations of value iteration in complex environments with large observation
    spaces, and we discussed how to overcome them with Q-learning. We checked the
    Q-learning algorithm on the FrozenLake environment and discussed the approximation
    of Q-values with NNs, as well as the extra complications that arise from this
    approximation.

    since 2015 to improve DQN convergence and quality, which (combined) can produce
    state-of-the-art results on most of the 54 (newly added) Atari games. This set
    was published in 2017, and we will analyze and reimplement all of the tricks.
