    developer culture has revolutionized machine learning efforts in recent years.
    Training data, the lifeblood of machine learning, has become widely available
    and easily consumable in recent years. Computing power has made the required horsepower
    available to small businesses and even individuals. The current decade is incredibly
    exciting for data scientists.

    While the underlying platforms are actively developed and openly shared, usage
    is limited largely to machine learning practitioners due to difficult installations,
    non-obvious configurations, and difficulty with productionizing solutions.

    learning capabilities squarely into the realm of casual tinkerers and novice programmers.
    Meanwhile, high-performance features, such as—multiGPU support, make the platform
    exciting for experienced data scientists and industrial use as well. TensorFlow
    also provides a reimagined process and multiple user-friendly utilities, such
    as **TensorBoard,** to manage machine learning efforts. Finally, the platform
    has significant backing and community support from the world's largest machine
    learning powerhouse--Google. All this is before even considering the compelling
    underlying technical advantages, which we'll dive into later.

    have already successfully ported over existing machine learning projects. Some
    examples include handwriting recognition, language translation, animal classification,
    medical image triage, and sentiment analysis. The wide applicability of machine
    learning to so many industries and problems always intrigues people. With TensorFlow,
    these problems are not only feasible but easily achievable. In fact, we will tackle
    and solve each of the preceding problems within the course of this book!

    multiple operating systems. The basic installation is CPU-only, while more advanced
    installations unleash serious horsepower by pushing calculations onto the graphics
    card, or even to multiple graphics cards. We recommend starting with a basic CPU
    installation at first. More complex GPU and CUDA installations will be discussed
    in [Appendix](8022db02-d24f-4620-9da7-ae53df279306.xhtml), *Advanced Installation*.

    On Windows, we can only use TensorFlow with Python 3.5.x or 3.6.x. It can also
    be easily used on Windows by running a **Linux **virtual machine**** (**VM**).
    With an Ubuntu virtual machine, we can use TensorFlow with Python 2.7\. However,
    we can't use TensorFlow with GPU support in a virtual machine. As of TensorFlow
    1.2, TensorFlow doesn't provide GPU support on macOS. Therefore, if you want to
    use macOS with GPU-enabled TensorFlow, you will have to compile from sources,
    which is out of the scope of this chapter. Otherwise, you can still use TensorFlow
    1.0 or 1.1, which provides GPU support out of the box on macOS. Linux and Windows
    users can use TensorFlow with both CPU and GPU support.
