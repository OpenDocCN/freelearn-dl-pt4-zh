- en: '**Deep learning** (**DL)** is an increasingly popular topic that attracts the
    attention of the largest corporations as well as that of all kinds of developers.
    Over the past five years, this field has seen massive improvements that have ultimately
    led us to think of DL as a highly disruptive technology with immense potential.
    Virtual assistants, speech recognition, and language translation are just a few
    examples of the direct implementation of DL techniques. Compared to image recognition
    or object detection, these applications use sequential data, where the nature
    of every result depends upon that of the previous one. For example, you can''t
    produce a meaningful translation of a sentence from English to Spanish without
    tracking the words from beginning to end. For these kinds of problems, a specific
    type of model is being used—the **recurrent neural network** (**RNN**). In this
    book, we will cover the basics of RNNs and focus on some practical implementations
    using the popular DL library TensorFlow. All examples are accompanied by in-depth
    explanations of the theory to help you understand the underlying concepts behind
    this powerful but slightly complex model. Reading this book will leave you confident
    in your knowledge of RNNs and give you a good head start in using this model for
    your own specific use cases.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](d6266376-9b8b-4d69-925b-a4e56307951b.xhtml),  *Introducing Recurrent
    Neural Networks*, will provide you with a brief introduction to the basics of
    RNNs and will compare the model to other popular models and demonstrate why RNNs
    are the best. This chapter will then illustrate RNNs with the use of an example.
    You will also be given insight into the problems that RNNs have.'

    RNN with TensorFlow*, will explore how to build a simple RNN to solve the problem
    of identifying sequence parity. You will also gain a brief understanding of the
    TensorFlow library and how it can be utilized for building DL models. After reading
    this chapter, you should have a full understanding of how to use TensorFlow with
    Python and how easy and straightforward it is to build a neural network.'

    Book Chapter*, will also introduce a new and more powerful RNN model called the
    **gated recurrent unit** (**GRU**). You will learn how it works and why we are
    choosing it over the simple RNN. You will also go step by step over the process
    of generating a book chapter. By the end of this chapter, you should have gained
    both a theoretical and a practical knowledge that will give you the freedom to
    experiment with any problems of medium difficulty.'

    Translator*, will walk you through building a fairly sophisticated neural network
    model using the sequence-to-sequence model implemented with the TensorFlow library.
    You will build a simple version of a Spanish-to-English translator, which will
    accept a sentence in Spanish and output its English equivalent.'

    Assistant*, will then look on the practical side of RNNs and have you build a
    conversational chatbot. This chapter reveals a full implementation of a chatbot
    system that manages to construct a short conversation. You will then create an
    end-to-end model that aims to yield meaningful results. You will make use of a
    high-level TensorFlow-based library called TensorLayer.'

    will focus on improving your RNN''s performance with data and tuning. You will
    also look into optimizing the TensorFlow library for better results.'
