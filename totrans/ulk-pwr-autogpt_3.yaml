    ChatGPT responds directly with its answer to whatever we ask it. But how does
    this relate to prompts?

- en: The text we send is called a prompt; it can be a question, a statement, a task,
    or just whatever we want to tell the **large language model** (**LLM**) . However,
    this text is not fed into the LLM directly.

    a response. They can take several forms, such as a question, a statement, or a
    task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this would be a question prompt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    while a task prompt might be *Write a short story about a spaceship*. Each type
    of prompt serves a different purpose and can elicit different types of responses
    from the model. Understanding how to use these different types of prompts effectively
    is key to getting the most out of your interaction with Auto-GPT.

    cream*” never appeared in the training data, an LLM would have a harder time understanding
    the sentence, given that the tokens are not related. “Buy” would be related to
    “car” and “ice cream,” but “car” and “ice cream” would be considerably unrelated.

- en: Embeddings
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Embeddings are a crucial part of how Auto-GPT generates prompts. They are essentially
    a way of representing words and phrases in a numerical form that a model can understand.
    Each word or phrase is represented as a point in a multidimensional space, where
    the distance and direction between points can represent the relationship between
    words or phrases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, in this multidimensional space, the words “king” and “queen” might
    be close together, indicating a strong relationship, while “king” and “ice cream”
    would be further apart, indicating a weaker relationship. This is how a model
    understands context and can generate relevant responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of creating these embeddings involves breaking down the input text
    into tokens, which can be words, parts of words, or even single characters, depending
    on the language. These tokens are then mapped to vectors in the multidimensional
    space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model then uses these vectors to generate a response. It does this by calculating
    the probability of each possible next token, based on the current context. The
    token with the highest probability is selected, and the process is repeated until
    a complete response is generated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a simplified explanation of the process, and the actual implementation
    involves a lot more complexity, including the use of attention mechanisms to determine
    which parts of the input are most relevant, and the use of transformer models
    to handle long sequences of tokens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the key takeaway is that a model generates prompts by understanding
    the context of the input and calculating the most probable next token. This is
    why the phrasing of prompts is so important, as it can greatly influence the model’s
    understanding of the context and, therefore, the generated response.

    some context about the setting, characters, and plot before giving the actual
    prompt. This could be done through a more detailed prompt or by utilizing the

    establishes the rules of engagement. For instance, constraints such as “*Never
    argue with the user*” and “*You are a helpful assistant*” set the tone and direction

    a task. This ranges from creating code files for projects that only contain placeholders
    to fabricating facts that sound contextually appropriate. For example, in certain
    situations, it might discuss a topic closely related to the context’s keywords.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hallucination in language models such as GPT happens when the model produces
    text that appears plausible but is unanchored in reality. This is often the result
    of the model working with ambiguous or insufficient information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take, for instance, if you request the model to write a story about a non-existent
    character. It might “hallucinate” details about the character’s life, appearance,
    or traits. While this can yield creative and unforeseen results, it can also lead
    to text that is illogical or unrelated to the original prompt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A case in point is when I asked Auto-GPT to develop a `three.js`-based RPG browser
    game. It began researching how to gather weather data from a non-existent API.
    This was a result of processing excessive context with GPT-3.5-turbo, which I
    had used before transitioning to GPT-4.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Auto-GPT’s memory sometimes harbors incorrect facts or memories. To economize
    tokens, its memory is condensed by *Chat Completion* prompts with GPT. This can
    lead to misunderstandings, especially when summarizing texts that have already
    been summarized and merging these summaries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    For example, if writing a weather API tool and a web-based game are both related
    to “JavaScript,” the model might perceive the weather API as a relevant topic.
    Such confusion is less frequent with GPT-4, thanks to its advanced parameters

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have longer-term repercussions. As the model integrates this interaction into

    instructs GPT to retain as much information as possible to prevent topic shifts,
    hallucinations, or previous steps being forgotten.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A specific issue arises when Auto-GPT focuses on a particular task but encounters
    an unrelated prompt. For example, if it receives a command irrelevant to the ongoing
    context, the model might lose track of its previous actions. It could end up in
    a loop of searching for information related to the new input, attempting to reconcile

    off that question by explaining that it is not the main focus, it could get confused
    and drop the previous task, either partially or completely. This could result
    in a very inaccurate future behavior, or even the issue escalating to GPT not
    responding correctly to the Auto-GPT module that communicates with it, causing
    a fatal error.

    or it will keep checking the weather in later steps if Auto-GPT does not manage
    to compress its memory correctly (for example, when it tries to summarize the
    memory to reduce data amounts, it may put more emphasis on weather data now).

    prompts with the defined role and goal in the AI settings. Clear, specific prompts
    that align with these parameters are more likely to yield relevant responses,
    while prompts that don’t align can confuse the model.

    Auto-GPT generates prompts. We started by defining prompts and their importance
    in shaping the responses of the language model. We learned that prompts can be
    questions, statements, tasks, or any text that we want to communicate to a language
    model.

    and guiding a model’s responses. We examined how specific constraints can influence
    the tone, direction, and ethical boundaries of the conversation.

    embedding, context understanding, response generation, attention mechanisms, and
    transformer models. We learned that a model generates prompts by understanding
    the context of the input and calculating the most probable next token.

    of specificity, clarity, context, and experimentation. We also looked at examples
    of effective and confusing prompts, demonstrating how alignment with the defined
    role and goal in the AI settings can influence a model’s responses.

    how effective prompts align with the defined role and goal, while confusing prompts
    do not.

    prompts can significantly enhance your interaction with a model. The key is to
    craft clear, specific prompts that align with the model’s role and goal, provide
    ample context, and not be afraid to experiment.
