- en: For companies that depend on machine learning, it is very important to deploy
    their models in a scalable fashion. The models should work in the same manner
    that they were working in when the model was created. Deploying fastText models,
    both supervised and unsupervised, can be done in a variety of ways. The choice
    of methodology would depend on your individual needs.

    will probably need to deploy them to production so that those models can be utilized
    to create applications and endpoints to use. There are a lot of frameworks in
    Python that can be used to create such web apps. Flask, Django, and Pyramid are
    some popular Python web frameworks. In this section, we will take the example
    of flask and build a simple web nearest neighbor search application in flask.

- en: Flask is a popular web framework, and it is classified as a microframework as
    it does not require any external tools or libraries. There are no database abstraction
    layers, or form validation, or other components built into flask. The advantage
    of this is that you can build a simple web app in flask with minimal lines of
    code. This helps fast prototyping and helps you to focus on the application code
    itself.

    in the repository. You will find two files, `ft_server.py` and `ft_utils.py`.
    The `ft_utils.py` module has the code related to the fastText server, and `ft_server.py`
    has the code related to the flask endpoints.

    `FT_MODEL` environment variable. This model is loaded as a global variable so
    that it can be utilized in the functions as well. Another advantage is that when
    the flask app is initialized, the model will also be loaded into memory. Loading
    the model into memory is computationally expensive and hence if we defer that
    operation to the initialization phase, that will improve the response timings:'

    to shift the computationally expensive portions of the code to the app initiation
    phase as much as possible. This is generally a good idea. As part of the web app,
    only do what is absolutely necessary and keep the amount of computation as part
    of serving the request to the minimum. This will ensure that you are building
    effective and useful web apps to for deploying fastText models and machine learning
    apps in general.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some points that I would like to mention here. We are going to use
    the fastText FTZ models here. You can argue as we had seen, fastText models are
    built using product quantization using methods such as nearest neighbor centroid
    estimations, pruning of vocabularies and hashing. This results in loss of information,
    although it is argued that there is no significant loss in performance. But if
    you are not convinced, you have the option of creating the web app as discussed
    in the previous section and accessing the results from your Android app, which
    means having the Android app as a view-only, and deferring all the computation
    to the server. That is a fair course to take, but is more of an engineering challenge
    and not within the scope of this book. In this section, we are more interested
    in finding out whether we can leverage the capabilities of fastText to create
    really small models, deploy them in mobile devices, and use them in our applications.
  prefs: []

- en: Now before we go ahead, build the APK and take note of the present size of the
    application, since size is an important matter for users if you want users to
    download and use the application. You probably don't want your users to uninstall
    the application because the memory is full, or the user is in a place where the
    internet is really slow and it will take a long time to download the application.
    So, keep the application size always in mind when designing applications for smaller
    devices.

    a way to access the file and serve the predictions. One way that you can do this
    is that you can write Java custom code using the fastText GitHub repository as
    a reference. The advantage of this approach is that you have more control over
    the code, and that might be the only option if you are writing an enterprise application,
    since the code of fastText is given under the BSD license. Another option is to
    take the fastText code and compile the code as part of the Android library, but
    there are a lot of issues with serving native code and it may not work on all
    devices. The best approach for me when adding external dependencies is if you
    can find core Java libraries that do the work for you.
