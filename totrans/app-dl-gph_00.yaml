- en: In recent years, the rapid growth of networked data across fields such as social
    networks, molecular structures, recommendation systems, and computer vision has
    highlighted the need for better methods to process graph-structured data. Traditional
    deep learning models work well with grid-like data (such as images) and sequential
    data (such as text), but these models struggle with irregular structures such
    as graphs.
