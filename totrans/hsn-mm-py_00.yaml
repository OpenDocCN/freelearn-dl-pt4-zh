- en: Using **Hidden Markov Models** (**HMMs**) is a technique for modeling Markov
    processes with unobserved states. They are a special case of **Dynamic Bayesian
    Networks** (**DBNs**) but have been found to perform well in a wide range of problems.
    One of the areas where HMMs are used a lot is speech recognition because HMMs
    are able to provide a very natural way to model speech data. This book starts
    by introducing the theoretical aspects of HMMs from the basics of probability
    theory, and then talks about the different applications of HMMs.

    Markov chains. The chapter also talks about the different types of Markov chain
    classifying based on continuous or discrete states and time intervals.'
