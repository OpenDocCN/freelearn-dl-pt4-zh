<p class="mce-root"><span>With deep learning gaining rapid mainstream adoption in modern-day industries, organizations are looking for ways to unite popular big data tools with highly efficient deep learning libraries. This will help deep learning models train with higher efficiency and speed.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>With the help of <em>Apache Spark Deep Learning Cookbook</em>, you'll work through specific recipes to generate outcomes for deep learning algorithms without getting bogged down in theory. From setting up Apache Spark for deep learning to implementing types of neural nets, this book tackles both common and not-so-common problems in order to perform deep learning on a distributed environment. In addition to this, you'll get access to deep learning code within Spark that can be reused to answer similar problems or tweaked to answer slightly different problems. You‘ll also learn how to stream and cluster your data with Spark. Once you have got to grips with the basics, you'll explore how to implement and deploy deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, and LSTMs in Spark using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. At the end of the day, this is a cookbook designed to teach how to practically apply models on Spark, so we will not dive into the theory and math<br/>
behind the models used in this chapter, although we will reference where additional<br/>
information on each model can be obtained.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>By the end of the book, you'll have the expertise to train and deploy efficient deep learning models on Apache Spark.</span></p>

<p>This book is for anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning and big data concepts and who is looking to expand their understanding through a top-down rather than a bottom-up approach. This book gives access to deep learning as well as machine learning algorithms in a plug-and-play fashion. Anyone without previous programming experience, especially with Python, can easily implement the algorithms in this book by following the recipes step by step as instructed. Most of the code in this book is self-explanatory. Each code block performs one particular function or executes on the action in mining, manipulating, transforming, and fitting data to deep learning models.</p>
<p>This book is intended to give the reader both hands-on experience through fun projects such as stock price prediction, as well as a more solid understanding of deep learning and machine learning concepts This is possible the numerous links provided to online resources, such as published papers, tutorials, and guides, throughout every chapter in the book.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "S<span>ave under the </span><kbd>trained</kbd><span> folder inside the working directory</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">print('Total Rows')<br/>df.count()<br/>print('Rows without Null values')<br/>df.dropna().count()<br/>print('Row with Null Values')<br/>df.count()-df.dropna().count()</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>nltk.download("punkt")</strong><br/><strong>nltk.download("stopwords")</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Right-click on the page and click on <span class="packt_screen">Save As...</span></span><span>"</span></p>
