- en: Machine Learning has revolutionized the modern world. Many machine learning
    algorithms, especially deep learning, have been used worldwide, ranging from mobile
    devices to cloud-based services. TensorFlow is one of the leading open source
    software libraries and helps you build, train, and deploy your Machine Learning
    system for a variety of applications. This practical book is designed to bring
    you the best of TensorFlow and help you build real-world Machine Learning systems.
