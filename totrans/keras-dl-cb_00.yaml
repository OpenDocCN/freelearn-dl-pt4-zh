- en: If you're aware of the buzz surrounding terms such as machine learning, artificial
    intelligence, or deep learning, you might know what neural networks are. Ever
    wondered how they help solve complex computational problems efficiently, or how
    to train efficient neural networks? This book will teach you both of these things,
    and more.

- en: You will start by getting a quick overview of the popular TensorFlow library
    and see how it is used to train different neural networks. You will get a thorough
    understanding of the fundamentals and basic math for neural networks and why TensorFlow
    is a popular choice. Then, you will proceed to implement a simple feedforward
    neural network. Next, you will master optimization techniques and algorithms for
    neural networks using TensorFlow. Further, you will learn how to implement some
    more complex types of neural networks such as **convolutional neural networks**
    (**CNNs**), **recurrent neural networks** (**RNNs**), and **Deep Belief Networks**
    0;(**DBNs**). In the course of the book, you will be working on real-world datasets
    to get a hands-on understanding of neural network programming. You will also get
    to train generative models and will learn the applications of autoencoders.

    the power of TensorFlow to train neural networks of varying complexities, without
    any hassle.

- en: This book is meant for developers with a statistical background who want to
    work with neural networks. Though we will be using TensorFlow as the underlying
    library for neural networks, this book can be used as a generic resource to bridge
    the gap between the math and the implementation of deep learning. If you have
    some understanding of Tensorflow and Python and want to learn what happens at
    a level lower than the plain API syntax, this book is for you.
