<p class="calibre2">In this section, you will learn how to use fastText models in conjunction with other popular NLP libraries, such as Gensim and spaCy. You will also learn how to make fastText part of your pipeline, which will probably include these other tools as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">TheÂ <a href="part0115.html#3DLGM0-05950c18a75943d0a581d9ddc51f2755" class="calibre9">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre16">FastText in Python</em>, is about creating models in Python, either using the official Python bindings for fastText, or you can choose to use the Gensim library, which is a popular Python library for NLP.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the <a href="part0143.html#48C0E0-05950c18a75943d0a581d9ddc51f2755" class="calibre9">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre16">Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models</em>, you will understand how to integrate fastText into your NLP pipeline if you have pipelines already built using either the statistical machine learning or deep learning paradigms. In the case of statistical machine learning, this chapter takes the example of the scikit-learn library, and in the case of deep learning, Keras, Tensorflow, and PyTorch are taken into account.</p>
