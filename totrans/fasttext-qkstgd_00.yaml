- en: FastText is a state-of-the-art tool that can be used to perform text classification
    and build efficient word representations. It is open source and is designed at
    **Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research** (**FAIR**) lab. It is written in
    C++, and you also have wrappers available in Python.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has the ambitious goal of covering all and techniques and know-how
    that you need to build NLP applications in the real world. It will also cover
    the algorithms on which fastText is built so that you will clearly understand
    the context in which you can expect the best results from fastText.

- en: This book will be of benefit to you if you are a software developer/machine
    learning engineer trying to understand the state-of-the-art in NLP. A large part
    of the book deals with real-life problems and considerations for creating an NLP
    pipeline. If you are an NLP researcher, there is a lot of value here because you
    will learn about the internal algorithms and considerations taken while developing
    the fastText software. All the code examples are written in Jupyter Notebooks.
    I highly recommend you type them out, change them, and tinker with them. Keep
    the code handy so that you can use it later in your actual projects.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0021.html#K0RQ0-05950c18a75943d0a581d9ddc51f2755), *Introducing
    FastText*, introduces fastText and the NLP context in which this library is useful.
    It will map the motivations behind building the library and the intended usage
    and benefits that the creators of the library intended to bring into NLP and the
    field of computational linguistics. There will also be specific instructions explaining
    how to install fastText on your work machine. Upon completion of this chapter,
    you will have fastText installed and running on your computer.'

    Models Using the FastText Command Line*, discusses the rich command line that
    the fastText library provides. This chapter describes the default command-line
    options and shows how to use it to create models. If you are only interested in
    having a superficial introduction to fastText, reading up to this chapter should
    be enough.'

    Classification in FastText*, introduces the algorithms that power sentence classification
    in fastText. You will also learn how fastText compresses big models into smaller
    models that can be deployed to low-memory devices.'

    Learning and Deep Learning Models*, explains how to integrate fastText into your
    NLP pipeline if you have pre-built pipelines that use either statistical machine
    learning paradigms or deep learning paradigms. In the case of statistical machine
    learning, this chapter makes use of the scikit-learn library; and in the case
    of deep learning, Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are taken into account.'

- en: Ideally, you should have a basic knowledge of how Python code is written and
    structured. If you are not familiar with Python or are not clear how programming
    languages work in general, then please take at look at a book on Python. A book
    dealing with Python from a data science perspective would be ideal for you.

    book should be easy for you to grasp. If you are starting out in NLP, that should
    not be too much of an issue if you are willing to dive deep into the mathematics
    covered. I have taken care to explain the mathematical concepts covered in this
    book, but if this too seems too difficult, please write to us and let us know.
