<p class="mce-root"><span>Using <strong>Hidden Markov Models</strong> (<strong>HMMs</strong>) is a technique for modeling Markov processes with unobserved states. They are a special case of <strong>Dynamic Bayesian Networks</strong> (<strong>DBNs</strong>) but have been found to perform well in a wide range of problems. One of the areas where HMMs are used a lot is speech recognition because HMMs are able to provide a very natural way to model speech data. This book starts by introducing the theoretical aspects of HMMs from the basics of probability theory, and then talks about the different applications of HMMs.</span></p>

<p><a href="c8b01245-1f2b-4b5e-837f-bdcc1d87343e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to Markov Process</em><span>, starts with a discussion of basic probability theory, and then introduces Markov chains. The chapter also talks about the different types of Markov chain classifying based on continuous or discrete states and time intervals.</span></p>
<p><a href="9b42b071-f9e8-454d-a242-1ee47aceba2c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Hidden Markov Models</em><span>, builds on the concept of Markov processes and DBNs to introduce the concepts of the HMM.</span></p>
<p><a href="943542b6-74f4-460d-8e90-e20a3c0334a6.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="943542b6-74f4-460d-8e90-e20a3c0334a6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>State Inference – Predicting the States</em><span>, introduces algorithms that can be used to predict the states of a defined HMM. The chapter introduces the Forward algorithm, the backward algorithm, the forward-backward algorithm, and the Viterbi algorithm.</span></p>
<p><a href="8d06a68a-e427-4f7d-9472-9be25b5351c0.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Parameter Inference Using Maximum Likelihood</em><span>, discusses the basics of maximum likelihood learning. The chapter then moves on to applying maximum likelihood learning in the case of HMMs and introduces the Viterbi learning algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm.</span></p>

<p><a href="b3f2bff1-0fe7-4d54-8a9e-9911c77e7d62.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Parameter Inference Using Bayesian Approach</em><span>, starts by introducing the basic concepts of Bayesian learning. The chapter then applies these concepts in the case of HMMs and talks about the different approximation methods used for learning using the Bayesian method.</span></p>
<p><a href="98385586-e031-4234-98c6-3cd7be42f22d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Time Series Predicting</em><span>, discusses the application of HMMs in the case of time series data. The chapter takes the example of the variation of stock prices and tries to model it using an HMM.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Now, let's define the </span><kbd>MFCTagger</kbd><span> class</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>from </span>hmmlearn.hmm <span>import </span>GaussianHMM<br/><span>import </span>numpy <span>as </span>np<br/><span>import </span>matplotlib.pyplot <span>as </span>plt</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>pip install matplotlib datetime</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "The possible states of the outcomes are also known as the <strong>domain of the random variable</strong>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
