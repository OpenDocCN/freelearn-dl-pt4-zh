- en: The **Markov Decision Process** (**MDP**) forms the basis of setting up RL,
    where the outcome of a decision is semi-controlled; that is, it is partly random
    and partly controlled (by the decision-maker). An MDP is defined using a set of
    possible states (**S**), a set of possible actions (**A**), a real-values reward
    function (**R**), and a set of transition probabilities from one state to another
    state for a given action (**T**). In addition, the effects of an action performed
    on one state depends only on that state and not on its previous states.

    the model is represented in the form of transition probabilities and the key objective
    is to determine the optimal policy and value functions using these predefined
    model attributes (that is, `TPMs`). The policy is defined as a learning mechanism
    of an agent, traversing across multiple states. In other words, identifying the
    best action of an agent in a given state, to traverse to a next state, is termed
    a policy.

    transitioning from state *st* to state *s[t+1]* by performing an action at.

- en: Unlike model-based learning, where dynamics of transitions are explicitly provided
    (as transition probabilities from one state to another state), in model-free learning,
    the transitions are supposed to be deduced and learned directly from the interaction
    between states (using actions) rather explicitly provided. Widely used frameworks
    of mode-free learning are **Monte Carlo** methods and the **Q-learning** technique.
    The former is simple to implement but convergence takes time, whereas the latter
    is complex to implement but is efficient in convergence due to off-policy learning.

    exploration of the surrounding environment and exploitation of existing knowledge
    is termed off-policy convergence. For example, an agent in a particular state
    first explores all the possible actions of transitioning into next states and
    observes the corresponding rewards, and then exploits current knowledge to update
    the existing state-action value using the action generating the maximum possible
    reward.
