- en: Reinforcement learning is one of the most exciting and rapidly growing fields
    in machine learning. This is due to the many novel algorithms developed and incredible
    results published in recent years.

- en: In this book, you will learn about the core concepts of RL including Q-learning,
    policy gradients, Monte Carlo processes, and several deep reinforcement learning
    algorithms. As you make your way through the book, you'll work on projects with
    datasets of various modalities including image, text, and video. You will gain
    experience in several domains, including gaming, image processing, and physical
    simulations. You'll explore technologies such as TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym to
    implement deep learning reinforcement learning algorithms that also predict stock
    prices, generate natural language, and even build other neural networks.

- en: By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience with eight reinforcement
    learning projects, each addressing different topics and/or algorithms. We hope
    these practical exercises will provide you with better intuition and insight about
    the field of reinforcement learning and how to apply its algorithms to various
    problems in real life.
