- en: Deep learning is one of the most commonly discussed areas in machine learning
    due to its ability to model complex functions and learn through a variety of data
    sources and structures, such as cross-sectional data, sequential data, images,
    text, audio, and video. Also, R is one of the most popular languages used in the
    data science community. With the growth of deep learning, the relationship between
    R and deep learning is growing tremendously. Thus, *Deep Learning Cookbook in
    R* aims to provide a crash course in building different deep learning models.
    The application of deep learning is demonstrated through structured, unstructured,
    image, and audio case studies. The book will also cover transfer learning and
    how to utilize the power of GPU to enhance the computation efficiency of the deep
    learning model.
