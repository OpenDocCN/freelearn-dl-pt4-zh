- en: With continuously evolving research and development, **Generative Adversarial
    Networks** (**GANs**) are the next big thing in the field of deep learning. This
    book highlights the key improvements in GANs over traditional generative models
    and shows you how to make the best out of GANs with the help of hands-on examples.

- en: This book will help you understand how GAN architecture works using PyTorch.
    You will get familiar with the most flexible deep learning toolkit and use it
    to transform ideas into actual working code. You will apply GAN models to areas
    such as computer vision, multimedia, and natural language processing using a sample-generation
    methodology.

    GAN with PyTorch*, introduces you to a classic and well-performing GAN model,
    called DCGAN, for generating 2D images. You will also be introduced to the architecture
    of DCGANs and learn how to train and evaluate them. Following this, you will learn
    how to use a DCGAN to generate hand-written digits and human faces, and take a
    look at adversarial learning with autoencoders. You will also be shown how to
    efficiently organize your source code for easy adjustments and extensions.'

    high-resolution images from low-resolution ones and how to use a data prefetcher
    to speed up data loading and increase your GPU''s efficiency during training.
    You will also learn how to train a GAN model to perform image inpainting and fill
    in the missing parts of an image.'
