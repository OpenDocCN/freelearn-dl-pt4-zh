- en: This Learning Path takes a step-by-step approach to teach you how to get started
    with data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Each module is designed
    to build on the learning of the previous chapter. The book contains multiple demos
    that use real-life business scenarios for you to practice and apply your new skills
    in a highly relevant context.

- en: In the first part of this Learning Path, you will learn entry-level data science.
    You'll learn about commonly used libraries that are part of the Anaconda distribution,
    and then explore machine learning models with real datasets to give you the skills
    and exposure you need for the real world.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second part, you'll be introduced to neural networks and deep learning.
    You will then learn how to train, evaluate, and deploy Tensorflow and Keras models
    as real-world web applications. By the time you are done reading, you will have
    the knowledge to build applications in the deep learning environment and create
    elaborate data visualizations and predictions.

- en: If you’re a Python programmer stepping out into the world of data science, this
    is the right-way to get started. It is also ideal for experienced developers,
    analysts, or data scientists, who want to work with TensorFlow and Keras. We assume
    that you are familiar with Python, web application development, Docker commands,
    and concepts of linear algebra, probability, and statistics.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Jupyter Fundamentals*, covers the fundamentals of data analysis
    in Jupyter. We will start with usage instructions and features of Jupyter such
    as magic functions and tab completion. We will then transition to data science
    specific material. We will run an exploratory analysis in a live Jupyter Notebook.
    We will use visual assists such as scatter plots, histograms, and violin plots
    to deepen our understanding of the data. We will also perform simple predictive
    modeling.,'

- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Data Cleaning and Advanced Machine Learning*, shows how predictive
    models can be trained in Jupyter Notebooks. We will talk about how to plan a machine
    learning strategy. This chapter also explains the machine learning terminology
    such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, classification, and regression.
    We will discuss methods for preprocessing data using scikit-learn and pandas.,'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Web Scraping and Interactive Visualizations*, explains how to
    scrap web page tables and then use interactive visualizations to study the data.
    We will start by looking at how HTTP requests work, focusing on GET requests and
    their response status codes. Then, we will go into the Jupyter Notebook and make
    HTTP requests with Python using the Requests library. We will see how Jupyter
    can be used to render HTML in the notebook, along with actual web pages that can
    be interacted with. After making requests, we will see how Beautiful Soup can
    be used to parse text from the HTML, and used this library to scrape tabular data.'

    set up and configure deep learning environment and start looking at individual
    models and case studies. It also discusses neural networks and its idea along
    with their origins and explores their power.'

    from a deep learning model. We will deploy our Bitcoin prediction model as an
    application that is capable handling new data by creating a new models.'

- en: This book will be most applicable to professionals and students interested in
    data analysis and want to enhance their knowledge in the field of developing applications
    using TensorFlow and Keras. For the best experience, you should have knowledge
    of programming fundamentals and some experience with Python. In particular, having
    some familiarity with Python libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
    will be useful.
