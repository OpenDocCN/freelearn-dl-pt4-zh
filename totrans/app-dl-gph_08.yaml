    form sentences, and sentences form documents, which contain concepts that interlink
    in complex ways to convey meaning. Graph structures provide an ideal framework
    to capture these intricate relationships, going beyond the traditional models.
    By representing text as graphs, we can leverage the rich expressiveness of graph
    theory and the computational power of deep learning to tackle challenging **natural
    language processing** ( **NLP** ) problems.

- en: Dialogue systems are sophisticated AI-powered applications designed to facilitate
    human-computer interaction through natural language. These systems employ various
    NLP techniques such as natural language understanding, dialogue management, and
    natural language generation to interpret user inputs, maintain context, and produce
    appropriate responses. Modern dialogue systems often integrate machine learning
    algorithms to improve their performance over time, adapting to user preferences
    and learning from past interactions. They find applications in diverse fields,
    including customer service, virtual assistants, educational tools, and interactive
    storytelling, continuously evolving to provide more natural and effective communication
    between humans and machines.

    dialogue context, knowledge, and semantic relationships, these systems can better
    understand user intents, track conversation states, and generate more coherent

    dialogue systems, responsible for maintaining an up-to-date representation of

    a graph, where *nodes* represent utterances, slots, and values, while *edges*
    capture the relationships between these elements. As the conversation progresses,
    the graph is dynamically updated, and GNN layers are applied to propagate information
    across the graph, enabling more accurate state predictions.

    is first converted into a graph representation, and then a graph-aware decoder
    generates the response. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies
    and complex relationships within the conversation history.

    ) constructs a dialogue graph that captures both the local context (recent utterances)
    and global context (overall conversation flow). The model then uses graph attention
    mechanisms to generate responses that are more consistent with the entire conversation
    history. This approach represents conversations as structured graphs where *nodes*
    represent utterances and *edges* capture various types of relationships between
    them, such as temporal sequence and semantic similarity. The graph structure allows
    the model to better understand long-range dependencies and thematic connections
    across the dialogue, moving beyond the limitations of traditional sequential models.
    Furthermore, the graph attention mechanism helps the model focus on relevant historical
    context when generating responses, even if it occurred many turns earlier in the
    conversation.

    high-end restaurants and premium taxis, it can apply this pattern to new conversations.

    This becomes particularly problematic with transformer-like architectures where
    each connection also stores attention weights and edge features. Modern NLP tasks
    often deal with much longer sequences or multiple documents simultaneously, making
    this quadratic scaling unsustainable for both memory usage and computational resources.
    Common mitigation strategies include sparse attention mechanisms, hierarchical
    graph structures, and sliding window approaches, but these can potentially lose
    important long-range dependencies in the text. Please refer to [*Chapter 5*](B22118_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093)
