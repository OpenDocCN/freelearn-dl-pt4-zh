<p class="mce-root"><span>Deep learning is probably the hottest technology in data science right now, and R is one of the most popular data science languages. However, R is not considered as an option for deep learning by many people, which is a shame, as </span>R is a wonderful language for data science. This book shows that R is a viable option for deep learning, because it supports libraries such as MXNet and Keras.</p>
<p class="mce-root">When I decided to write this book, I had numerous goals. First, I wanted to show how to apply deep learning to various tasks, and not just to computer vision and n<span>atural language processing. This book covers those topics, but it also shows how to use deep learning for </span>prediction, regression, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems. The second goal was to look at topics in deep learning that are not covered well elsewhere; for example, interpretability with LIME, deploying models, and using the cloud for deep learning. The last goal was to give an overall view of deep learning and not just provide machine learning code. I think I achieved this by discussing topics <span>such </span>as how to create datasets from raw data, how to benchmark models against each other, how to manage data when model building, and how to deploy your models. My hope is that by the end of this book, you will also be convinced that R is a valid choice for use in deep learning.</p>

<p>If you have some experience with R and are looking for a book that shows some practical examples of how to use R for deep learning, this is the book for you! This book assumes that you are familiar with some of the concepts in machine learning, such as splitting data into train and test sets. Anyone who has built machine learning algorithms in R should have no problem with this book.</p>

<p><a href="00c01383-1886-46d0-9435-29dfb3e08055.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em><span>Getting Started with Deep Learning</span></em><span>, gives an introduction to deep learning and neural networks. It also gives a brief introduction on how to set up your R environment.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="cb00118a-2bba-4e43-ba55-c4552c508b7e.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em><span>Training a Prediction Model</span></em><span>, begins with building neural network models using the existing packages in R. This chapter also discusses overfitting, which is an issue in most deep learning models.</span></p>
<p><a href="6e6dd858-9f00-454a-8434-a95c59e85b25.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em><span>Deep Learning Fundamentals</span></em><span>, teaches how to build a neural network in R from scratch. We then show how our code relates to MXNet, a deep learning library.</span></p>
<p><a href="28315a07-2bf0-45c8-8e6f-0e4f01616ca3.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em><span>Training Deep Prediction Models</span></em><span>, looks at activations and introduces the MXNet library. We then build a deep learning prediction model for a real-life example. We will take a raw dataset of transactional data and develop a data pipeline to create a model that predicts which customers will return in the next 14 days.</span></p>
<p><a href="1c0b9897-b0cc-4a8f-9ce8-e6409c347f4f.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em><span>Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks</span></em><span>, looks at image classification tasks. First, we will introduce some of the core concepts, such as convolutional and pooling layers, and then we will show how to use these layers to classify images.</span></p>
<p><a href="13e9a742-84df-48e5-bbfd-ade33dcdd01a.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em><span>Tuning and Optimizing Models</span></em><span>, discusses how to tune and optimize deep learning models. We look at tuning hyperparameters and using data augmentation.</span></p>
<p><a href="03f666ab-60ce-485a-8090-c158b29ef306.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em><span>Natural Language Processing Using Deep Learning</span></em><span>, shows how to use deep learning for <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>) tasks. We show how deep learning algorithms outperform traditional NLP techniques, while also being much easier to develop.</span></p>
<p><a href="49a1fa27-1130-4f86-966e-cc73444b88a2.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em><span>Deep Learning Models Using TensorFlow in R</span></em><span>, looks at using the TensorFlow API in R. We also look at some additional packages available within TensorFlow that make developing TensorFlow models simpler and help in hyperparameter selection.</span></p>
<p><a href="e0045e3c-8afd-4e59-be9f-29e652a9a8b1.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em><span>Anomaly Detection and Recommendation Systems</span></em><span>, shows how we can use deep learning models to create embeddings that are lower order representations of data. We then show how to use embeddings for anomaly detection and to create a recommendation system.</span></p>
<p><a href="2ea4d422-70f7-47af-a330-f0901f6f5fd3.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>,<span> </span><em><span>Running Deep Learning Models in the Cloud</span></em><span>, covers how to use AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud services to train deep learning models. This chapter shows how to train your models at low-cost in the cloud.</span></p>
<p><a href="94299ae0-c3fc-4f1d-97a8-5e8b85b260e9.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>,<span> </span><em><span>The Next Level in Deep Learning</span></em><span>, concludes the book with an end-to-end solution for image classification. We take a set of image files, train a model, reuse that model for transfer learning and then show how to deploy that model to production. We also briefly discuss <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong> (<strong>GANs</strong>) and reinforcement learning.</span></p>

<p>This book does not assume that you have access to a high-end machine or even a machine with a GPU. To get the most out of this book, I recommend that you execute all the code examples. Experiment with them, change the parameters, and try to beat the metrics in the book.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>dfData &lt;- read.csv(fileName)<br/>nobs &lt;- nrow(dfData)<br/>train &lt;- sample(nobs, 0.9*nobs)<br/>test &lt;- setdiff(seq_len(nobs), train)</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>&gt; dfResults<br/>        w stem stop  nb_acc svm_acc  nn_acc  rf_acc  best_acc<br/><strong>12 binary    1    1   86.06   95.24   90.52   94.26     95.24</strong><br/>9  binary    0    1   87.71   95.15   90.52   93.72     95.15<br/>10 tfidf     1    1   91.99   95.15   91.05   94.17     95.15<br/>3  binary    0    0   85.98   95.01   90.29   93.99     95.01</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ tensorboard --logdir /tensorflow_logs</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
