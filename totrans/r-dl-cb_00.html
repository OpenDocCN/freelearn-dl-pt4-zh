<p class="calibre2">Deep learning is one of the most commonly discussed areas in machine learning due to its ability to model complex functions and learn through a variety of data sources and structures, such as cross-sectional data, sequential data, images, text, audio, and video. Also, R is one of the most popular languages used in the data science community. With the growth of deep learning, the relationship between R and deep learning is growing tremendously. Thus, <em class="calibre9">Deep Learning Cookbook in R</em> aims to provide a crash course in building different deep learning models. The application of deep learning is demonstrated through structured, unstructured, image, and audio case studies. The book will also cover transfer learning and how to utilize the power of GPU to enhance the computation efficiency of the deep learning model.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the include directive."</p>
<p class="calibre2">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="calibre20">
[default]<br class="title-page-tagline"/> exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br class="title-page-tagline"/> exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br class="title-page-tagline"/> exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)<br class="title-page-tagline"/> exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)
