<p class="mce-root">Machine Learning has revolutionized the modern world. Many m<span>achine learning</span> algorithms, especially deep learning, have been used worldwide, ranging from mobile devices to cloud-based services. TensorFlow is one of the leading open source software libraries and helps you build, train, and deploy your <span>Machine Learning</span> system for a variety of applications. This practical book is designed to bring you the best of TensorFlow and help you build real-world <span>Machine Learning</span> systems.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this book, you will have a deep understanding of TensorFlow and be able to apply <span>Machine Learning</span> techniques to your application.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <kbd>include</kbd> directive."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px" class="CodePACKT">batch_size = 128 <br/>  num_steps = 10000 <br/>  learning_rate = 0.3 <br/>  data_showing_step = 500</pre>
<p class="mce-root">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="CodePACKT"><strong>Layer 1 CONV (32, 28, 28, 4) </strong><br/><strong>Layer 2 CONV (32, 14, 14, 4) </strong><br/><strong>Layer 3 CONV (32, 7, 7, 4)</strong></pre>
<p><span>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</span></p>
<pre><strong>sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev</strong></pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>important words</strong><span> </span>are shown in bold.</p>
