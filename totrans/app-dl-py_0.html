<p class="mce-root">This Learning Path takes a step-by-step approach to teach you how to get started with data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Each module is designed to build on the learning of the previous chapter. The book contains multiple demos that use real-life business scenarios for you to practice and apply your new skills in a highly relevant context.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>In the first part of this Learning Path, you will learn entry-level data science. You'll learn about commonly used libraries that are part of the Anaconda distribution, and then explore machine learning models with real datasets to give you the skills and exposure you need for the real world.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">In the second part, you'll be introduced to neural networks and deep learning. You will then learn how to train, evaluate, and deploy Tensorflow and Keras models as real-world web applications. By the time you are done reading, you will have the knowledge to build applications in the deep learning environment and create elaborate data visualizations and predictions.</p>

<p>If you’re a Python programmer stepping out into the world of data science, this is the right-way to get started. It is also ideal for experienced developers, analysts, or data scientists, who want to work with TensorFlow and Keras. We assume that you are familiar with Python, web application development, Docker commands, and concepts of linear algebra, probability, and statistics.</p>

<p><span><em>Chapter 1</em>, <em>Jupyter Fundamentals</em>, covers the fundamentals of data analysis in Jupyter. We will start with usage instructions and features of Jupyter such as magic functions and tab completion. We will then transition to data science specific material. We will run an exploratory analysis in a live Jupyter Notebook. We will use visual assists such as scatter plots, histograms, and violin plots to deepen our understanding of the data. We will also perform simple predictive modeling.,</span></p>
<p><span><em>Chapter 2</em>, <em>Data Cleaning and Advanced Machine Learning</em>, shows how predictive models can be trained in Jupyter Notebooks. We will talk about how to plan a machine learning strategy. This chapter also explains the machine learning terminology such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, classification, and regression. We will discuss methods for preprocessing data using scikit-learn and pandas.,</span></p>
<p><em>Chapter 3</em>, <em>Web Scraping and Interactive Visualizations</em>, explains how to scrap web page tables and then use interactive visualizations to study the data. We will start by looking at how HTTP requests work, focusing on GET requests and their response status codes. Then, we will go into the Jupyter Notebook and make HTTP requests with Python using the Requests library. We will see how Jupyter can be used to render HTML in the notebook, along with actual web pages that can be interacted with. After making requests, we will see how Beautiful Soup can be used to parse text from the HTML, and used this library to scrape tabular data.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em>, <em>Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning</em>, helps you set up and configure deep learning environment and start looking at individual models and case studies. It also discusses neural networks and its idea along with their origins and explores their power.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em>, <em>Model Architecture</em>, shows how to predict Bitcoin prices using deep learning model.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 6</em>, <em>Model Evaluation and Optimization</em>, shows on how to evaluate a neural network model. We will modify the network's hyper parameters to improve its performance.</p>
<p><span><em>Chapter 7</em>, <em>Productization</em>, explains how to create a working application from a deep learning model. We will deploy our Bitcoin prediction model as an application that is capable handling new data by creating a new models. </span></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>We can see the </span><kbd>NotebookApp</kbd><span> being run on a local server</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><span>fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2)<br/>sns.regplot('RM', 'MEDV', df, ax=ax[0],<br/>scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.4}))<br/>sns.regplot('LSTAT', 'MEDV', df, ax=ax[1],<br/>scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.4}))</span></pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><span>    cat chapter-1/requirements.txt<br/>    <strong>matplotlib==2.0.2</strong><br/><strong>    numpy==1.13.1</strong><br/><strong>    pandas==0.20.3</strong><br/><strong>    requests==2.18.4</strong></span></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>pip install version_information </strong><br/><strong>pip install ipython-sql</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Notice how the <strong>white dress</strong> price was used to pad the <strong>missing values</strong>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
