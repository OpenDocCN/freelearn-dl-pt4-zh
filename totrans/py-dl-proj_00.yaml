- en: Have you ever tried to get something novel out of a computer? I can ask you
    to make up a story or look at a picture and tell me what's in it. How would you
    make a computer program behave like this in contrast to the digital storage and
    transfer unit we've used them for these past 30+ yrs?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you had perfect knowledge and all the time in the world, you could write
    all the rules by which a computer program would need to operate. Of course, if
    you had all the knowledge to define the operational rules, you wouldn't need the
    computer to do anything! So what do you do if you need a computer to function
    in complex ways (making predictions, classifications, optimizing processes, generating
    content, responding to interactions, performing robotic controls), but don't have
    all the heuristic rules defined?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You build an algorithmically-based application that can learn the rules, find
    the pattern, or determine the signal, from data that comes from the domain space
    in question. You set up the training such that it iterates incredibly fast and
    with a great number of cycles (we call them epochs) to provide the "experience"
    to incrementally train the model in a process that would not be possible in a
    human lifetime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we build these algorithmic architectures in layers, we create deep learning
    models that can learn features (for example, dogs have tails and cars have wheels)
    and these learned features are powerful! What we really find in *Python Deep Learning
    Projects* is that we can ask profound questions not possible before. It's these
    questions that drive our deep learning technologies to solve problems that range
    from healthcare diagnostics in radiology to cancer screening. Deep learning applications
    drive chatbot experiences, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, recommendation
    engines, and marketing tech. The hard sciences of physics, biology, and chemistry
    are incorporating deep learning skills training just as they have in the past
    with regard to statistics and microscopes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is perfect for you if you've undertaken at least one course in machine
    learning and have a modest functional proficiency in Python (meaning you can create
    programs in Python when supported by examples). Many of our readers will be undergraduates
    at university studying computer science, statistics, mathematics, physics, biology,
    chemistry, marketing, and business. Deep learning technologies are being applied
    to all the professions that these degrees prepare you for, and this book is a
    great way to learn skills that will be applicable to your success. Postgraduates
    will appreciate the instruction level, too, as the projects selected are directly
    applicable to the modern job market, from tech start-ups to enterprise applications.
