- en: On completion of this section, you will have working knowledge of how fastText
    goes about creating both supervised and unsupervised models. Additionally, you
    will have knowledge of the algorithms and the design decisions that went into
    incorporating those algorithms into fastText.

    Classification in FastText*, you will get to know about the algorithms that power
    sentence classification in fastText. You will also get to know how fastText is
    able to compress big models into smaller models that can be deployed to low memory
    devices.
